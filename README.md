# React Mobile Assignment (Dragonborn's Encyclopaedia)

A small mobile app developed for using as a companion to Skyrim Special Edition by bethesda studio.

The app is still in development stage. And as of now you can track every book (All 542) in vanilla skyrim special edition, create custom list in checklist style for user's own preference. 


## Features

- Keep track of all books in Skyrim
- Create Custom Lists
- Explore Nexus Mods Updated, Trending and Latest Added mods


## Description

As of now the app can only be run locally because the database is not connected to a cloud service. However here's a brief description on how the app (should) work.

The user has to register or login to access the app's functionalities. Once accessed the app will connect to the database for the first time to get the booklist from the database. 

After the initial connection the booklist will be saved as a local copy and the user can use that list to keep track of the books accross Tamriel. The changes only apply to the local copy such as changing the owned status.

The custom list section is to create custom lists for users for other items that they want to keep track of. These are designed to share with every user so if they want, they can save that list to their local storage and use it as a custom checklist. 

Next section shows the top 10 trending, updated and latest added mods from the nexus mods. 

## Roadmap

- Implement a voting system to custom lists 

- Add mod search section for nexus

- Add UESP wiki section to help users to take guides 

- Add a bug report forum for users to share common bugs and fixes

- Connect the database to a cloud service

- Create a ios model

- Change color theme to fit better with skyrim

- Add support for books and items added by third party mods to the game
